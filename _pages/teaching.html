I have experience as the sole instructor for:
* PUBPOL 528: Memo writing for International Students
* Math Camp for incoming MPA students
* Math Camp for incoming PhD students

I have been a teaching assistant for several courses in the core MPA curriculum:
* PUBPOL 511: Managing Politics and the Policy Process
* PUBPOL 527: Quantitative Analysis I
* PUBPOL 526: Program Evaluation

I have also served two years as the teaching assistant for the [International Program in Public Health Leadership](https://evans.uw.edu/faculty-research/research-centers-and-projects/international-program-in-public-health-leadership/), a policy and leadership program for mid-career public health professionals in Africa. In this role, I oversee the policy project, coordinate interactions between fellows and advisors, and guest lecture on economic evaluation in public health.
