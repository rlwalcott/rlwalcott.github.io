Hello! I am a PhD Candidate at the Evans School of Public Policy & Governance at the University of Washington. My research interests are broad and include international development, financial inclusion, global health, and domestic health policy. I am primarily a quantitative methodologist who thrives in a multi-disciplinary, applied research environment. My dissertation work examines innovative public policy initiatives to support financial inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa. I hold a Master's in Public Health (MPH) from the University of Georgia, along with graduate certificates in Global Health and Disaster Management.
